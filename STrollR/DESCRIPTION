Description: A computationally efficient way to calculate
    covariance matrices that are corrected for spatial and temporal
    correlation using a method I call *rolling*. Huge spatiotemporal
    covariance matrices can be calculated using sparse matrix approaches
    with spam and spam64. To calculate large sparse spatial weights
    matrices, use spam::rdist.
