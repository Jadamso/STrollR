Description: A computationally efficient way to calculate covariance matrices that are corrected for spatial and temporal correlation using a method I call *rolling*. Huge spatiotemporal covariance matrices can be calculated using sparse matrix approaches with spam and spam64. To calculate large sparse spatial weights matrices, use spam::rdist.
